# ScratchStats+
ScratchStats+ is a website that shows statistics for projects, users and many more!

## Using
To see the website, go to https://scratchStatisticsOfficial.github.io.

## Implementation
The website is not complete, as the styling is in a beta version and many more features are to be included.

It uses Bootstrap for the plain CSS styling and responsiveness, and vanilla JavaScript (for now) for fetching the data.

It collects the data from the Scratch API and the ScratchStats.com API.

All code is front-end, with no dependency external on servers.

## Contributing
You are free to contibute on the project, as long as you have read our Code of Conduct
